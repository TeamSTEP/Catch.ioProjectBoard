# Project Catch.io Task Repository

## Introduction

This is a project racking repository for project Witch One, also internally known as Catch.io.

Because our source code is kept inside a private repository, issue tracking must be managed from a separate public repository to allow anyone (including non-developers) to view it.
This repository will only contain the current active team membership list and our current tasks in a form of Github issues.
Every other information related to the development of the project will be described in our [developer manual](https://teamstep.github.io/catch.io-docs/index.html).
For information about the game itself, please check our [game design document](https://team-step.gitbook.io/witch-one-design-doc/).
