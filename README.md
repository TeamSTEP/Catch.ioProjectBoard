## Introduction

This is a progress tracking repository for project Witch One, also internally known as Catch.io.

Because our source code is kept inside a private repository, issue tracking must be managed from a separate public repository to allow anyone (including non-developers) to view it.
This repository will contain the current active team membership list and our current tasks in the form of Github issues.
Internal notes and task records are stored on the cloud and through other task management solutions.
