# Project Catch.io

## Introduction

This is the project manual for **Catch.io** and a repository for tracking issues and tasks related to the development of Catch.io.
The actual source code for the project will be managed in a separate private repository, while the projects are stored in here.
If you are part of Team STEP and Catch.io development, team feel free to add new tasks or comment on existing ones.

Every information that is required for developing with the Project Catch.io team will be documented here.
Such information includes:

- Project folder structure
- Coding styles and guidelines
- Project contribution format (semantic version for this project, Pull
  Request format, etc.)
- Milestones and progress reporting methods
- Team roles
- Documentation format

and more...

You can think of this as a general guidelines for how to unify the development process so it is easier for others to join in. So project team members should document their work and tell everyone how you want others to handle your work. Project docs are meant for internal use but you shouldn't assume that others might already know what is what. Think of the docs as a way to express your creative works.
Please keep in mind that you are not expected to read all the docs, but you are expected to understand the parts that is related to your task.

Regarding the development flow, please refer to this doc: <https://github.com/hoonsubin/project-guidelines/blob/master/GithubGuide.md.>

For the design documents of Project Catch.io, please refer to this foc: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4EkQDDCehgophNas1bUkacxGfCYO78z-fND64eFN4Q/>

This README doc acts as an introduction to the entire docs so please feel free to add or change the contents as you write more docs.

## Abbreviations & Definitions

To increase the efficiency of communications between members, it is good to use abbreviations. If there are any abbreviations (and the definition of that word) you are using that is foreign to other new members, please add it here.

- PR: Pull Request (when merging a branch or a fork to the master
  repository)
- Repo: Repository (Git repository)
- doc: Documentation (Projects documentation like this one will be referred to as docs)
- WIP: Working In Progress
- impl: short for implement or implementation
- LGTM: Looks Good to Me (used when a PR does not have any issues and is good to merge)

## How to Write Documents

Project docs like this one must be written in Markdown. I recommend using [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) to write a quick doc, or use the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension for VS code. Documentations should be long and comprehensive so anyone can understand.
As a general format, think of this README doc as a template to start from.

### Q: What should be a doc

Anything that requires more than one people to work on either now or in the future. Or if you have any special requirements regarding your work or working style, write a doc to express that to other members.

### Q: Who can write a doc

Anyone within the team. You will need other's permission to edit an existing doc (except for fixing typos or obvious problems), but creating a new one is completely up to you.

### Q: Any word requirements

It should be comprehensive, but not boring. There are no strict word count but it should be long enough to let the reader understand what you want to say and short enough to not make the reader fall asleep.
